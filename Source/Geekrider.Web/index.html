            			<p>
							A few months back I was challenged by a neighbor to enter something called <a href="http://www.birkebeiner.no/English/Birkebeinerrittet/">Birkebeinerrittet</a>, a cross country bicycle race with 18.000 participants.
							Being everything but fit, this is quite a challenge to accept. Nevertheless, I did accept it. <br>
							<br>
							As time flew by, I realized I would need all the motivation in the world to achieve this. The neighbor is one,
							he has stepped up to the plate and will be pushing my training forward on the right track. But as a geek, I felt
							I needed to make this a project. Even now, when I sit down and write this, I really don't see how I will push myself
							towards the goal - so my conclusion is, I need something that I can relate to that will push me forward towards the goal.
							<br>
							<br>
							So, what will this site become?  Well, I spent the better part of my spare time during the Christmas vacation contemplating
							that same question. I did create a full mockup of all the features I think I want to have on it, and some of the features
							might not even make the cut. But, my goal is to create a site were I can publish data regarding my current status and also
							be clear about the goals. I do have a few other ideas and as soon as I get time to develop them all, I'll publish them all here.
							My first goal however, is to get the engine that will power this site up and running. For now the page you're looking at is a
							static page, and being a software developer - I figured that the least I would do is to expand on my own knowledge and learn
							something new while doing the training and this as a project. I will return to the details of what I'm trying to achieve,
							technologically as well. Lets just say that it will be cloud based, rich clients, CQRS using <a href="http://bifrost.codeplex.com">Bifrost</a> and I'll also try to stick some 3D visualization in here using <a href="http://balder.codepldx.com">Balder</a>. 
							The two projects mentioned, being near and dare to me as open-source projects I'm managing and contributing as much as I can to.
